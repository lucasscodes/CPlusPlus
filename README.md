## In Progress:
//TODO: Continue here!
* GUI

## Chapters left:
* Binary trees MISSING
* Function Pointers MISSING
* Template Metaprogramming

## Integrated and Spiral Learning left:
This set of problems will cover templates, operator overloading (polymorphism), inheritance, friend functions, etc. They are presented in a spiral and integrated approach so as to maximize learning and minimize cognitive load.
* World!, Hello
* Generic Programming
* Inheritance 

## Own ideas left
* Modmenu for a SP-Game
    * Needs GUI first!
